My Approach to Building a SOTA Deepfake Detection Model (>95% Accuracy)
Based on cutting-edge research from 2024-2025, here's a comprehensive architecture strategy:

Architecture Design: Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Transformer Ensemble
Core Components:
1. Multi-Stream Feature Extraction

Spatial Branch:

Primary: Swin Transformer V2 or Vision Transformer (ViT)

Achieved 97.81-99.67% accuracy across benchmarks

Hierarchical feature learning with shifted windows

Linear complexity relative to image size

Secondary: EfficientNet-B4/B7 backbone

97.77% accuracy with unsharp masking preprocessing

Efficient scaling of depth, width, and resolution

Strong performance on resource-constrained environments

Frequency Domain Branch:

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Module for capturing frequency artifacts

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with block-wise processing

Multi-scale frequency feature extraction (local + global)

Proven to detect compression artifacts and GAN-specific patterns

Texture & Detail Branch:

Diversiform Pixel Difference Attention (DPDA) for subtle manipulation traces

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for texture analysis

2. Advanced Attention Mechanisms

Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Blocks: Channel-wise feature recalibration (98.5% AUC-ROC)

CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module): Spatial + channel attention

Bidirectional Interaction Cross-attention: Deep correlations between spatial and sequential features​

Residual Guided Spatial Attention (RSA): Focus on forgery-relevant regions

3. Temporal Analysis (for videos)

LSTM layers for sequential inconsistency detection

Spatio-temporal fusion between consecutive frames

4. Fusion Strategy

Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion: Integrate spatial, frequency, and temporal features

Frequency-Aware Attention Enhancement: Shallow-layer attention + deep-layer dynamic modulation​

Dropout layers in classification heads

Training Techniques:

Metric Learning: Triplet loss variants (Batch All)

Encourage separable embeddings between real/fake

Adversarial Training: Generate hard examples during training

Knowledge Distillation: Multi-knowledge transfer from teacher models

4. Preprocessing Pipeline
Face Detection & Extraction:

RetinaFace or MTCNN for accurate face detection

30% margin around bounding box

5. Training Configuration
Hyperparameters:

Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 1e-4
